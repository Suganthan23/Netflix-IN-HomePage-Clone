PROJECT TITLE: "Netflix Landing Page Front-End Clone"

DESCRIPTION:
A pixel-precise and responsive front-end clone of the Netflix landing page, built using HTML and CSS. This project replicates core visual components of Netflix's official homepage with emphasis on structure, responsiveness, and UI accuracy.

The clone includes:

✅ Header section with logo and Sign In button
✅ Hero section with promotional text and email subscription input
✅ Responsive feature cards arranged in a 2x2 layout
✅ Section titles and layout consistent with Netflix branding
✅ Font Awesome icons integrated for visual indicators
✅ Responsive design across all screen sizes

This project deepened my understanding of responsive web design, layout structuring with Flexbox, and using media queries for mobile adaptation. It also improved my attention to spacing, alignment, and front-end component styling.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
HTML5
CSS3 (Flexbox, Media Queries, Box Model)
Font Awesome (for icons)
Google Fonts

RESPONSIVENESS:
Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens using media queries and flexible layout structures to ensure a consistent user experience across devices.
